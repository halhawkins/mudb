## Violine

<a href="https://www.haroldhawkins/mudb/public">Violine</a> is a demonstration project. This site allows users to see record charts, discover new music, listen to and discuss tracks, albums and artists. Registered users can get recommendations based on their likes as well.

Violine is built upon Laravel 8 application framework and employs such packages as: <a href="https://github.com/aerni/laravel-spotify">aerni/laravel-spotify</a>, <a href="https://github.com/elegantweb/sanitizer">elegantweb/sanitizer</a> and <a href="https://github.com/alaouy/Youtube">alaouy/Youtube</a>
Violine leverages and integrates API data from Spotify, LastFM and YouTube.

Though this has been created for demonstration purposes, it is fully functional and development is ongoing.
